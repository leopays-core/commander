# LeoPays Commander

## Building

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your computer in order to build this app.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mlrd-chain/commander
$ cd commander
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

If you don't wish to clone, you can [download the source code](https://github.com/mlrd-chain/commander/archive/master.zip).

For easier developing you can launch the app in fullscreen with DevTools open:

```bash
$ yarn run dev
```
